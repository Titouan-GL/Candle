# Candle

## What it is

Candle is a small but difficult platformer game developped with Python and Pyagme when I was 16 y/o, in which you must travel through the levels in order to fight a boss.
there are currently 2 bosses and 2 levels, a 3rd boss is probably coming, so the game is not finished.

## How to play

you require Pygame and Python in order to play it

in the pause menu you can choose which key to use between :
- zqsd
- wasd
- directionnal arrow

the key "e" can trigger a few actions and "escape" can pause the game

there is no saves for now, if you quit the game you lose your progression.
the game also feature an easy mode, which grant you 2 additionnal health (which you're probably going to need if you don't want to spend half an hour on a boss)
